I chose a straightedge lifestyle at 14, so I was drawn to straightedge bands and then vegan straightedge bands. I went vegetarian my first year of college, but at the time thought veganism was extreme. 2.5 years later, I realized how ridiculous that thought was as I dove deeper into learning about animal agriculture and animal rights. It was only logical that I took the next step to oppose murder, torture, and rape.

For me, competition is always against myself. That is one of the reasons that I was drawn to the kettlebell sport. In kettlebell sport, you have to dig deep to fight the voices in your head that tell you to drop the bells. It's more mental strength than physical strength. By setting goals for competition, it's the difference between just working out and training. You train with purpose to reach a specific goal. It creates the drive to push yourself further. The process is what drives me more than the competition itself. I always strive to better myself and become more than what I was yesterday."}, {"key": "Biggest advantages to being a vegan athlete", "value": "That's a little hard for me to say.
